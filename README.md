ðŸŒ¾ Explore Salinity Indices using GEE


This project uses Google Earth Engine (GEE) to explore, calculate, and analyze different soil salinity indices based on Landsat 8 satellite imagery.
The goal is to assess soil salinity conditions across different spatial and temporal scales by using time series of indices derived from Landsat 8 data.

Main Features:

    Automatic calculation of several salinity indices (e.g., SI, S2SI, NDVI, NDWI, etc.).

    Interactive visualization of salinity indices directly on GEE.

    Seasonal comparison of soil salinity (dry season vs. rainy season).

    Export of results as raster files or time series charts.

Technologies:

    Google Earth Engine (Javascript API)

    Landsat 8 imagery

    Processing of vegetation, moisture, and salinity indices.

How to use:

    Open the script in the Google Earth Engine Code Editor.

    Adjust the study area if needed (geometry or region).

    Run the script to calculate and visualize the indices.

    Export results to Google Drive if necessary.

Example of computed indices:

    Salinity Index (SI)

    Normalized Difference Salinity Index (NDSI)

    Soil Salinity Index (SSI)

    NDVI, NDWI (for auxiliary analysis)
